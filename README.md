# Important update regarding this project
tl;dr This project has been a living nightmare to handle as of late due to how I approached it.

As of late I've been fairly stressed over trying to maintain this project. I feel like it's mainly because of how I approached it. I planned on adding a bit overtime but later it became me trying to do too many things at once for one update. As a result I decided to take a break from working on it for a while. I may even attempt to recreate it with a smaller scope for it's main release as opposed to what I'm doing with it now.
